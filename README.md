### Hello, world

I am a software developer with a background in Mechatronics Engineering. I am interested in all things tech, but mostly those that can provide sovereignty to the users.
My day to day job is as a Software Developer [@reaktor](https://github.com/reaktor).

Outside of my daily job, I dedicate my free time to work on/study things related to the BTC ecosystem, in hope that we can all become a better society.
